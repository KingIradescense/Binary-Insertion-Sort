Hello. This project was done for Design and Analysis of Algorithms in the fall of 2023 and is
meant to represent a binary insertion sort algorithm. The purpose of the project was to
detail understanding of this data structure as well as a prior knowledge of how to read/write
to file and error/exception handling. 

This project does not output the correct results when writing to file and it is believed
to be due to the sorting key value of default Students (the objects being sorted) is less than
that of the defined Students rather than greater, but this is the project as it was submitted.
